### What I learned

I found this project to be pretty interesting and useful. I had to research about dealing with time in JavaScript, which I had never used in a solo project before. Once I found a source for the countdown function, I understood it pretty well, and was able to easily implement it. Though I wanted to come up with a solution myself, I didn't want to spend much time in this challenge, so I just used the function I found on the internet. The bonus challenge was to make the a "flip" animation for the cards, and I found a solution for that, but decided not to use it, because I thought it was much ahead of my current abilities and it would take some time.
